    ### Let's Get Started!
    
    1. **Setting Up**: Fire up any text editor (like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac) or choose a dedicated code editor like Visual Studio Code. 
    
    2. **Basic Structure**: Every HTML document begins with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, followed by <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
    
    3. **Adding Content**: Want to add a heading? Use <h1>Your Heading</h1>. Paragraph? <p>Your text here</p>. Easy, right?
    
    4. **Images**: Inserting images is a breeze. <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">.
    
    5. **Links**: Want to link to another webpage? <a href="https://example.com">Link Text</a>.
    
    ### Beyond the Basics
    
    In just 5 minutes, you've laid the groundwork for understanding HTML. But don't stop here! HTML offers a plethora of tags and attributes to customize your web pages further. Dive deeper into lists, tables, forms, and more to enhance your skills.
    
    ### Practice Makes Perfect
    
    The best way to solidify your understanding of HTML is through practice. Experiment with different tags, play around with attributes, and gradually build your own web pages. Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is a stellar website.
    
    ### Conclusion
